## Commands

### pak extract

Extracts files from a given `.pak`.

```shell
$ retrotool pak extract [in_pak] [out_dir]
```

### pak package

Re-packages a `.pak`, given an extracted directory.

```shell
$ retrotool pak package [in_dir] [out_pak]
```

### txtr convert

```shell
$ retrotool txtr convert [in].TXTR
# writes to [in].dds

$ retrotool txtr convert --astc [in].TXTR
# writes to [in].astc
```
Converts a `.dds` file to swizzled file
```shell
$ retrotool swizzle -i [in].dds -o [out].bin -m [mip_size]
```
